* **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5, jQuery Validation

## ⚙️ Local Development Setup

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

1.  [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
2.  [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (Local install or Docker container)
3.  Visual Studio, VS Code, or JetBrains Rider.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/whiskeytracker.git](https://github.com/yourusername/whiskeytracker.git)
    cd whiskeytracker
    ```

2.  **Configure Database:**
    Ensure your `appsettings.json` (or `appsettings.Development.json`) contains a valid connection string to your local PostgreSQL instance.

    ```json
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=WhiskeyTracker;Username=postgres;Password=yourpassword"
    }
    ```

3.  **Apply Migrations:**
    Create the database schema using Entity Framework tools. Open your terminal in the project root:

    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    Open your browser to `https://localhost:7001` (or the port specified in the console).

## 📂 Project Structure

* **`Data/`**: Contains the C# entity models (`Whiskey.cs`, `Bottle.cs`, `TastingSession.cs`) and the EF Context.
* **`Pages/`**:
    * **`Whiskies/`**: Standard CRUD pages for managing the library and inventory.
    * **`Tasting/`**: The customized "Wizard" flow for tasting sessions.
    * **`Shared/`**: Layouts and partial views.
* **`wwwroot/images/`**: Stores uploaded bottle images.

## 📝 Roadmap / Future Features

* **Infinity Bottle:** Logic to track a living blend of whiskies.
* **Stats Engine:** Advanced analytics (Cost per dram, favorite regions).
* **Data Export:** Export collection to CSV/Excel.
* **Global Ratings:** Refactor static whiskey ratings to be an average of all tasting session scores.
* **Automated Unit Testing:** Add a test suite (xUnit or NUnit) to verify business logic and prevent regressions.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Add the ability to automatically deploy after a merge in GIT
